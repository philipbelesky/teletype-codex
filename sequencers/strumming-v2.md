# Strumming V2

## By Egon77

A chord sequencer designed for use with strumming triggers.

### Instructions

> I just wanted to share this “Strumming” Teletype script I wrote recently. I was inspired by a video of a Teletype scene created by Joe Filbrun (@EqualTemperament) of Teletype Talk, which is very much the same kind of thing. His is a strumming scene called Axe Thing One with up and down strumming, but his is even Grid controlled! So, you should definitely check out his scene too. Mine was a particular achievement for me because I wrote it without looking into Joe’s script. I just sort of knew how it should work and then sort of troubleshooted my way through it. Very satisfying to pass over the obstacles and know that I’m leveling up slightly in the realm of Teletype scripting.

> Patch **TR1** and **CV1** to an envelope and 1v/oct of an OSC respectively. Or if you have Mutable Instruments Rings send TR1 to the Strum input and CV1 to its 1v/oct. (Rings, as you can imagine, is perfect for this patch but it’s pretty interesting as well on regular oscillators and envelopes.)

#### Teletype Inputs

- Triggers sent into INPUT 8 are down-strums
- Triggers sent into INPUT 7 are up-strums
- The CHORD to be strummed can be set in PATT 0 / STEPS 0-5
- The PARAM knob controls the speed of the strum.
- Triggers sent into INPUT 6 are for sequencing the chords but more on that below.

See link below for information on sequencing chords, composing, strumming, etc.
