# Half Awake

## By Ninoshiro

A port of the Norn *Awake* app to Teletype. Displays a two track sequencer on a Grid, where the second sequence transposes the first.

### Instructions

- Script 1: advance and play sequence 1 (default 8 steps)
- Script 2: advance transposition sequence 2 (PARAM decides steps)
- Script 3: change note or transposition and “on/off” state for steps
- Script 4: morph note sequence or transposition sequence for steps that are on
- Script 5: morph sequence 1 with script 4
- Script 6: morph sequence 2 with script 4
- Script 7: reset sequence 1 playhead
- Script 8: reset sequence 2 playhead

> If you want to trigger scripts 1 and/or 2 externally remove them from the Metro script!
